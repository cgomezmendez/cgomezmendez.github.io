title: My first impressions on University Of People
---

It's been three weeks since I started my first course at [University Of People](https://www.uopeople.edu) a non-profit online university that let you get a bachelor or associate degree without going in person to a classroom. Important to differentiate between free and non-profit, it's not free, but tuition-free, which means that they do not charge for teaching or instruction but there is an Application fee and an assessment fee. (The World's First Tuition-free University, (n.d.), p. 1).

I choose UOP because I want a degree but I don't want the burden that's to have to go to a classroom and having to schedule my time around that, which usually means asking permissions at work to be able to take some classes and that sort of messy things that I wanted to avoid. It's self-paced at least in the sense that you don't need to be at an exact time and date to take the class but assessments do have a fixed date to be delivered.

I'm happy with the way it works until now, as I don't have an English Certification and I'm not from an English speaking country the course I'm taking first it's ENGL 0101 (English Composition 1) which it's a prerequisite in case you can't demonstrate your English knowledge with some kind of certification.

The learning platform it's based on Moodle which is Open Source and free. it's not really my first time using it is the same platform I was using on a local institution I took classes for a while before dropping out due to not being able to conciliate my work and life schedule with my study schedule.

They give you a syllabus with all the detail information about the course grading and the material that will be covered by the course each week. For English composition, it's a 9-week duration course which covers from how to take notes; to creating an essay.

There is also an area where one can see the grades one have in the course now, you can see it in overall, or in detail. Detail view showing any feedback the grade may have and how much it contributes to your final grade.

Something interesting is that most of the assessments that are done by your partners. You also have to review other people assignments giving a set of parameters defined by the teacher, give a grade and an overall feedback.

There is a [Yammer community](https://www.yammer.com/uopeoplewelcome) where you can ask any doubt you have or socialize with the other people in the university.

Overall I'm pretty positive about this whole experience, I'll be posting more as I get through the course.
