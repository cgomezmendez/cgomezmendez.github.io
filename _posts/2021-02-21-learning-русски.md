привет my friends, I just wanted to tell you that I decided to learn Russian. I felt that it would be nice to the languages I can communicate in, as of now I only know Spanish and a little bit of English, so why not to learn a third language?
I'm not following any specific course per se, but one that I've been checking out is [Real Russian Club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyJznKYS9kkP7RWWq3YAbFw), and got my [Notio.so](https://notion.so) all set to learn Russian after watching [Robin MacPherson - How To Build A Language Learning Productivity / Habit / Note-Taking SYSTEM with Notion | TUTORIAL
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec5tLVeZrFM).
Why Russian you may ask, well I'm planning on going on vacation to Russia, off course I could get around using English, but what would be the fun of it?
Also I saw that Russian different from English and other languages it's written as it sounds most like Spanish. I was also interested in Japanese, and Mandarin, but their alphabet it's too different from the latin one.
My plan as of know it's to practice everyday at least one hour on my pronunciation, I already know some basic worlds and how to pronounce them, I'm using [HiNative](https://hinative.com) and [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) to check if I'm doing it correctly.
Just wanted to share this with you all. I'm pretty confident that I can accomplish my goal, I want to be able to communicate at least on a bassic level with russian people.
