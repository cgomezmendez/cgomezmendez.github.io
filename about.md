Geek, fast food lover, dominican, programmer.

### More Information

I'm what you would call a geek; I'm in love with technology, especially with programming. I'm from a little country in the Carribean which is name is the Dominican Republic, I like to try out new things and I read Reddit more than what I'm willing to admit.

I love pizza, acoustic music, scify movies, and tv shows, My favorite tv show I would say it's Dr. Who (The new series, 2005). I'm also curious about history, I think that to know where we are going we need to know where we are coming from.

I've been living in Santo Domingo, the most populous city and capital of my country since 2010, but I'm actually from a little town called Montecristi. I grew to love this city and to call it mine.
